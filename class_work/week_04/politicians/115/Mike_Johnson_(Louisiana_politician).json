He ran unopposed in the [[special election]] called for February 21, 2015 to select a successor to [[Jeff R. Thompson]], a Republican who resigned the legislative seat to become a [[judge]] of the Louisiana 26th Judicial District Court for Bossier and [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster]] parishes.

In 1984, Patrick Johnson was burned and rendered permanently disabled in the fire which swept through Dixie Cold Storage. Lost in the tragedy was his colleague and friend, Captain Percy R. Johnson. Patrick Johnson is the inspiration of the book, ''Up  from the Ashes.'' By 1985, Patrick Johnson had overcome a 5 percent chance to survive and founded the [[nonprofit organization]], the Percy R. Johnson Burn Foundation, which over the years has helped more than fifteen thousand burn patients. Another of his organizations, PM Hazmat, Inc., provides safety and emergency training for industries, governments, and public safety entities.<ref name=fathersobit/>\\n\\nPatrick and Jeanne Johnson divorced, and Patrick married his surviving widow, the former Janis Gabriel, Mike Johnson's step-mother.
