DARREN SOTO MAKES HISTORY AS THE FIRST PUERTO RICAN TO REPRESENT FLORIDA IN THE U.S. CONGRESS], ''[[Latina(magazine)|Latina]]'', BY Raquel Reichard, November 11, 2016. Retrieved 13 November 2016.</ref> Prior to being elected to Congress, Soto served for four years in the [[Florida Senate]] and five in the [[Florida House of Representatives]], representing parts of the Orlando area.\\n\\n==History==\\nSoto was born in the borough of [[Ringwood, New Jersey]] to a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] father, O. Lou Soto, and an [[Italian-American]] mother, Jean Soto. From 1998 to 2001, he worked for [[Prudential Insurance]] in finance while he attended college.  He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Rutgers University]] in 2000, a [[Juris Doctor]] from  [[George Washington University]] in 2004, and opened his law practice the following year.\\n\\nSoto has a bachelor's degree in Economics, and attended Law School at George Washington University.  Soto is a commercial and civil rights attorney proudly practicing law in Central Florida. He is ardent defender of civil rights and is committed to rendering legal services pro bono to the community. In 2006, he was named class counsel in the federal class action brought on behalf of Hispanic voters against the City of Kissimmee in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.\\n\\nSoto is a former member of the Civil Service Board for the City of Orlando, served as the Treasurer of the Orange County Democrats and the Vice President of Communications for the Orange County Young Democrats (YD's). He was also the YD Co-Host for their Speak Easy events that provide a monthly forum for local and state leaders to speak to young voters.\\n\\n==Florida House of Representatives==\\nIn 2006, Soto ran for a seat in the [[Florida House of Representatives]] from the 40th District, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent State Representative [[Andy Gardiner]]. In April 2007, he emerged victorious from a crowded [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary in a special election to replace [[John Qui\\u00f1ones (politician)|John Quinones]], who had resigned to run for the [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]] Commission.<ref>{{cite news |title= 6 Democrats vie for Quinones' seat: Winner of March 20 primary faces GOP's Suarez in April |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-03-11/news/O49DISTRICT11_1_mcmanus-osceola-county-district-49 |publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}</ref> In the general election, Soto narrowly defeated former Democratic State Representative Tony Suarez, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, by 285 votes. Soto was overwhelmingly re-elected in 2008 and 2010.\\n\\nDuring his three terms in the Florida House, Soto passed legislation in several areas including curbing illegal street racing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=42216|title=Florida House of Representatives - CS/HB 97 - Street Racing|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}</ref> protecting families of fallen firefighters, and maintaining school safety. He also fought to protect homeowners' access to the courts in foreclosure proceedings as well as assured adequately funded courts to deal with the unprecedented housing crisis in Florida. Soto was a key voice in securing the passage of Sunrail to bring commuter rail to Central Florida. He also played a critical roll through his debates in stopping the split of the Florida Supreme Court and preventing an Arizona-styled immigration law from passing in Florida.\\n\\n==Florida Senate==\\nIn 2012, [[Florida Senate]] districts were redrawn, and Soto opted not to run for re-election in the House but instead to run for the newly created 14th District, which included predominantly Latino areas of [[Orange County, Florida|Orange]], [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola]], and [[Polk County, Florida|Polk Counties]]. He won his party's nomination uncontested and faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Will McBride, who had previously run for the [[United States Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2006|2006]]. Soto won the endorsement of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', which praised him as \\\"the rare Democrat who works productively across the aisle,\\\" citing his work to get \\\"Central Florida's [[SunRail]] commuter system approved.\\\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Senate District 8 Leaning Toward Darren Soto |url=http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/senate-district-8-leaning-toward-darren-soto |publisher=Sunshine State News|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}</ref> Though the contest was initially thought to be a toughly-fought one,<ref>{{cite news |title= For State Senate Districts 12, 13, 14 we endorse... |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-10-02/opinion/os-ed-endorse-senate-orange-100212-20121001_1_senate-district-andy-gardiner-darren-soto |publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}</ref> in the end, Soto overwhelmingly defeated McBride, winning over 70% of the vote.\\n\\nIn his first term in the Florida Senate in 2013, Soto passed legislation expediting the time for immigrant children receiving deferred action to acquire a driver's license, which was ultimately vetoed by Governor Rick Scott<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/0986|title=Senate Bill 0986 (2013) - The Florida Senate|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}</ref> setting off statewide protests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampa.cbslocal.com/2014/07/14/protesters-want-florida-to-allow-illegal-immigrants-to-obtain-drivers-licenses/|title=Protesters Want Florida To Allow Illegal Immigrants To Obtain Driver\\u2019s Licenses \\u00ab CBS Tampa|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}</ref>  He also played a critical role in reducing the statute of limitations from 5 years to 1 year for banks to collect foreclosure debt and helped start Florida's Hardest Hit Principal Reduction Program to assist struggling homeowners. When confronted with legislation that would expedite the execution process for people on death row in Florida, he unsuccessfully proposed an amendment that would \\\"raise the required jury vote from seven to 10 for death penalties,\\\" noting that Florida is the only state requiring a simple majority vote by the jury for the death penalty.<ref>{{cite news |title= Timely Justice Act, Measure Speeding Up Executions, Approved By Florida Senate |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/timely-justice-act_n_3180168.html |publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2014, Soto passed historic legislation answering the Florida Supreme Court's call to give them the authority to admit immigrant lawyers into the Florida Bar while being strong advocate for successful passage of legislation giving DREAMer's in-state tuition.
