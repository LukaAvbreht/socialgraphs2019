He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. On December 17, 2013, Latham announced he would not seek reelection next term, becoming the third member of the House to announce his retirement on the same day (along with Rep. [[Frank Wolf (politician)|Frank Wolf]] from Virginia and Utah Rep. [[Jim Matheson]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fagen|first=Cynthia|title=Three Congressman Announce Retirement on Same Day|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/retire-Mia-Love-election/2013/12/17/id/542419|publisher=Newsmax|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref>\\n\\n==Early life, education and career==\\n\\nLatham was born in [[Hampton, Iowa]], south of [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]], the son of Evelyn R. (n\\u00e9e Johansen) and Willard Chester Latham. His father was of English and Danish descent and his mother was of Danish ancestry.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/latham.htm</ref> He was raised on a farm in [[Alexander, Iowa|Alexander]], near Hampton.<ref name='WaPoBio' /><ref name='HouseBio' >{{cite web|url=http://www.tomlatham.house.gov/Biography/ |title=Biography |accessdate=2010-01-28 }}</ref> He was educated at [[Iowa State University]], but did not graduate.  Before entering the House, he was part-owner of Latham Seeds, a family-owned seed company founded by his father.  Latham sold his interest before running for Congress.<ref name='HouseBio' />\\n\\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\\nLatham was sworn in on January 3, 1995.\\n\\n===Committee assignments===\\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations]]'''\\n**[[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies|Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies]]\\n**[[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security|Subcommittee on Homeland Security]]\\n**[[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies|Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies]] (Chairman)\\n\\n===Leadership roles and Caucus memberships===\\n*Co-Chair, [[Congressional Hearing Health Caucus]]\\n*Congressional COPD Caucus\\n*Dean of Iowa's delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives\\n*Task Force for a Drug-Free America\\n*Prescription Drug Action Leadership Team\\n*Congressional Task Force for Affordable Natural Gas\\n*National Service Caucus\\n\\nLatham is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online [[poker]].  In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the [[Goodlatte]]-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4411]</ref>\\n\\nIn 2005, Latham introduced the \\\"Angie Fatino Save the Children from Meth Act\\\" in memory of an Iowa teenager who struggled with a [[Methamphetamine]] addiction for three years before she committed suicide at the age of 15 years in 1997. Though the bill died in committee, the Iowa legislature has since passed similar legislation and federal law has now been enacted limiting the sale of [[pseudoephedrine]].<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr3568</ref>\\n\\n==Political campaigns==\\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa, 2010#District 4}}\\nLatham was elected as the congressman for {{ushr|Iowa|5}} in 1994<ref name='WaPoBio' /> as part of the wave that allowed Republicans to take over the House for the first time since 1955. The 5th was far and away the most Republican district in the state, and Latham never faced a serious challenge as the 5th District's congressman. In 1994 he defeated Democrat Sheila McGuire garnering 61 percent of the vote. In 1996 he won 65 percent of the vote in defeating Democrat MacDonald Smith, and he ran unopposed in the 1998 election.<ref name='WaPoBio' />\\n\\nFor his first four terms, Latham represented a district that stretched from [[Sioux City]] in the northwest all the way to [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]].  The 2000 round of redistricting, however, significantly altered Iowa's congressional map. Latham's home in Alexander, along with most of the eastern third of his old district, was placed in the new 4th District in the north-central part of the state.  This district was considered much more competitive than Latham's old district.  For the 2008 elections, it had a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+0.4, making it one of the most marginal districts in the nation.  However, he was reelected four times from this district without much difficulty.  This may be because he is the only Iowan on the powerful [[House Appropriations Committee]].<ref name='WaPoBio' />  It is considered very difficult to unseat an Appropriations Committee member.\\n\\nIn the 2006 election, neither the Republican nor Democratic parties had a contested primary. His opponent in the 2006 general election was Selden Spencer, a neurologist from Huxley. Latham, who had moved to [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]], closer to the center of the district,  earned 57.3% of the vote as he won reelection.\\n\\nIn the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|2008 election]] Latham won against Democratic nominee Becky Greenwald with 61 percent of the vote even as [[Barack Obama]] carried the district by eight points.\\n\\nIn 2010, Latham won against Democratic nominee Bill Maske, a school administrator.\\n\\nIowa lost a district as a result of the 2010 census.  The new congressional map placed Latham and fellow Republican [[Steve King]] into the same district.  While it retained Latham's district number, it contains more of King's old territory.  Indeed, it closely resembled the territory Latham represented for his first four terms.<ref>[[Chris Cillizza|Cilizza, Chris]].
