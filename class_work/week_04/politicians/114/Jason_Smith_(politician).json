He is the son of Mary, a [[Factory|factory worker]], and Bill, a [[Pastor|minister]] and [[auto mechanic]]. During his early years, he worked on his grandfather's farm in Salem and developed a passion for [[agriculture]].

Less than one week after graduating from the [[University of Missouri]] in 2001, he began law school at [[Oklahoma City University School of Law|Oklahoma City University]]. Smith attributes his fast track through college and law school to knowing exactly what he wanted to do and that it needed to be done right away. While attending law school, Smith served as the Senator representing the law school in the Student Senate, the Vice President of the entire law school, and class secretary. Also while in law school, Smith became a licensed [[Real estate broker|real estate agent]] and formed his own small business specializing in property investment and development.
