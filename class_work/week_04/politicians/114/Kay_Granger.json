She is the first Republican woman to represent Texas in the U.S. House.\\n\\n==Biography and career==\\nGranger was born in [[Greenville, Texas]], and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, where she attended [[Eastern Hills High School]], which recognized her as a Distinguished Eastern Hills High School Graduate in 1993.<ref>[http://www.usacenters.com/kaygranger.html Kay Granger]{{Dead link|date=July 2014}}, USA Centers for Global Commercial & Investment Relations]. Retrieved October 25, 2007.</ref> She graduated from [[Texas Wesleyan University]]. She was elected to the [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] city council in 1989 and was elected Mayor in 1991.\\n\\nAfter the retirement of Congressman [[Pete Geren]] in 1996, both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican parties worked to recruit Granger. Republicans were particularly bullish on their chances of winning the 12th.  It had once been represented by Democratic [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Jim Wright]], but had been made significantly more affluent and Republican after the 1990 census.  Granger made the decision to run as a Republican, much to the dismay of local [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] activists, who criticized Granger as being too liberal. She was elected by a wide margin, taking 56 percent of the vote over the Democrat [[Hugh Parmer]], also a former Fort Worth mayor.  She was handily reelected in 1998 and has only faced serious opposition once\\u2014in 2000.  In 2008, Granger defeated Democratic challenger Tracey Smith with 67 percent of the vote.\\n\\nIn 2006, Granger was reelected to serve her sixth term in Congress. She was also elected [[Republican Conference Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Conference Vice Chair]], the fourth-ranking position among House Republicans, in November 2006. She is currently Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Subcommitee on State-Foreign Operations. She also sits on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]]'s [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense|Subcommittee on Defense]] (the first woman to do so), and the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies|Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education Subcommittee]]. She has served as a House Deputy Whip also while in Congress.\\n\\nGranger is the author of the book, ''What's Right About America, Celebrating Our Nation's Values''.\\n\\nIn August 2007, Kay Granger Elementary School opened in far north [[Fort Worth]] in the [[Northwest Independent School District]].  A school named for Granger's mother\\u2014Mullendore Elementary\\u2014was opened several years earlier in [[North Richland Hills, Texas]].

That bill included a provision known as the GIPSA rider (Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Act), which prohibited USDA from using any money to implement rules authorized in the 2008 Farm Bill to protect chicken farmers from industry retaliation.\\n\\nThe USDA rule in question was developed over a six year period, during which time USDA held numerous public forums and interviewed many farmers, processors and others. The final rule was designed by USDA to protect poultry, cattle and pig farmers from industry retaliation if they spoke out, and to ensure the farmers would have standing when negotiating contracts with large industrial meat processing companies.\\n\\nRep. Kaptur proposed two amendments during the markup in an effort to remove some or all of the GIPSA rider and allow USDA to enforce these 2008 Farm Bill protections. The first amendment she proposed attempted to remove the entire GIPSA rider, which is referred to here as section 730 of the bill. That amendment was declined. The second amendment focused specifically on allowing USDA enforcement of protections of farmers\\u2019 right to speak about their conditions without fear of retaliation. Rep. Kaptur noted several examples of this kind of retaliation. That amendment was also declined.\\n\\nThe following members of Congress voted against these Kaptur amendments: Kay Granger of Texas, John Abney Culberson of Texas, and John R. Carter of Texas.\\n\\n<nowiki>http://www.kaptur.house.gov/index.php/news-15011/articles-70036/3410-rep-marcy-kaptur-amendments-protecting-farmers-from-industry-retaliation</nowiki>\\n\\n==Personal life==\\nKay has three children and five grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Kay|url=http://www.kaygranger.house.gov/about-kay/kays-biography}}</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|30em}}\\n\\n== External links ==\\n* [http://kaygranger.house.gov/ Congresswoman Kay Granger] official U.S. House site\\n* [http://www.kaygranger.com/ Kay Granger for Congress]\\n* {{Dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Texas/Government/Federal/US_House_of_Representatives/Kay_Granger_%5BR-12%5D}}\\n* {{C-SPAN|kaygranger}}\\n* {{CongLinks | congbio = g000377 | ballot = Kay_Granger | nndb = 723/000038609 | votesmart = 334 | govtrack = 400157 | opencong = 400157 | rollcall = 469 | politifact = | fec = H6TX12060 | opensecrets = N00008799 | assets = kay-granger | legistorm = 256/Rep_Kay_Granger_TX.html | followthemoney = | ontheissues = TX/Kay_Granger.htm | congress = kay-granger/1487 | worldcat = lccn-no94-14423 | cspan = 45709 | imdb = 1927247 | bloomberg = | nyt = | wsj = | washpo = gIQAJGdW9O }}\\n* [http://www.texastribune.org/directory/kay-granger/ Profile] at the ''[[Texas Tribune]]''\\n\\n{{s-start}}\\n{{s-off}}\\n{{succession box | before=[[Bob Bolen]] | title=[[List of mayors of Fort Worth, Texas|Mayor of Fort Worth, Texas]] | years=1991\\u20131995 | after=[[Jewel Woods]]}}\\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\\n{{USRepSuccessionBox\\n| state=Texas\\n| district=12\\n| before=[[Pete Geren]]\\n| years=1997\\u2013Present\\n| after=Incumbent}}\\n{{s-prec|usa}}\\n{{s-bef|before=[[Diana DeGette]]<br><small>D-[[Colorado]]</small>}}\\n{{s-ttl|title=''[[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|United States Representatives by seniority]]''|years=73rd}}\\n{{s-aft|after=[[Rub\\u00e9n Hinojosa]]<br><small>D-[[Texas]]</small>}}\\n{{s-ppo}}\\n{{succession box\\n|title=Vice-Chairman of [[Republican Conference Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]]\\n|before=[[Jack Kingston]]<br>Georgia\\n|years=2007\\u20132009\\n|after=[[Cathy McMorris Rodgers]]<br>Washington}}\\n{{s-end}}\\n\\n{{TX-FedRep}}\\n{{USHouseCurrent}}\\n{{Texas Women's Hall of Fame}}\\n{{Authority control}}\\n\\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\\n| NAME              =Granger, Kay\\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American politician\\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =January 18, 1943\\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =[[Greenville, Texas]]\\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\\n}}\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Granger, Kay}}\\n[[Category:1943 births]]\\n[[Category:Living people]]\\n[[Category:Mayors of Fort Worth, Texas]]\\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Texas]]\\n[[Category:Texas Republicans]]\\n[[Category:American Methodists]]\\n[[Category:Women mayors of places in the United States]]\\n[[Category:International Republican Institute]]\\n[[Category:People from Hunt County, Texas]]\\n[[Category:Female members of the United States House of Representatives]]\\n[[Category:Women state legislators in Texas]]\\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]\"}]}}}}"
