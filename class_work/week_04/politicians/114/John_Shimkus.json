He is the son of Kathleen N. (n\\u00e9e Mondy) and Gene L. Shimkus.

He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Of the bill, he said: \\\"When you're talking about the health and safety of folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I think that most Americans would support the government having that authority.\\\"<ref name=\\\"food safety\\\"/>\\n\\n===Climate change===\\nShimkus rejects the human-induced theory of climate change and opposes [[emissions trading]] legislation. Shimkus has quoted the Bible to allay concerns of global warming induced rise in sea levels, stating that God had promised mankind through Noah that the earth would never again be destroyed by a flood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/44958.html |title=John Shimkus cites Genesis on climate change - Darren Samuelsohn |publisher=Politico.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref> He acknowledged that climate change is real, but questioned the benefit of spending taxpayer money on something that cannot be changed versus the changes that have been occurring forever. Specifically, Shimkus said, \\\"\\u201cNow, do I believe in climate change? In my trip to Greenland, the answer is yes. The climate is changing. The question is more about the costs and benefits and trying to spend taxpayer dollars on something that you cannot stop versus the changes that have been occurring forever.

The project would be an oil pipeline, bringing Canadian [[crude oil]] through the Midwest, including Illinois.

He was defeated by 10-year [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[Dick Durbin]].\\n\\nFour years later, Durbin gave up the seat to make what would be a successful run for the [[United States Senate]]. Shimkus won a crowded six-way primary, and faced [[Illinois House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Jay C. Hoffman]] in a close general election, which Shimkus won by just over 1,200 votes.\\n\\nHe has only faced one credible opponent since his initial reelection, in 2002. That year, Illinois lost a district as a result of the 2000 census, and his district was merged with the 19th District of two-term Democratic representative [[David D. Phelps]]. The new district retained Phelps' district number, but geographically and demographically was more Shimkus' district, as he retained 60 percent of his former territory. The campaign was very bitter, with both men accusing the other's staffers of stalking their families.<ref name=\\\"stay close\\\"/> Despite a Democratic wave that swept through most of the state, he was easily reelected.\\n\\nHe announced in September 2005, that he would run for reelection in 2008, despite making a pledge<ref name=\\\"pledge\\\"/> when first elected in 1996 not to stay in office for more than 12 years.\\n\\n==Electoral history==\\nThe {{ushr|Illinois|20|20th district}} was disbanded after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], which is why Shimkus faced [[David D. Phelps]], incumbent of the 19th district, in the 2002 election. The 19th district was disbanded after the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], so Shimkus ran in the redistricted 15th district. The district includes much of the southern portion of the state, including a portion of the [[Metro-East]], which is the Illinois side of the [[St. Louis]] area.\\n\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\" style=\\\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\\\"\\n|+ {{ushr|Illinois|20}}: Results 1992, 1996\\u20132000<ref name=\\\"clerkresults\\\"/>\\n!|Year\\n!\\n!|Democratic\\n!|Votes\\n!|Pct\\n!\\n!|Republican\\n!|Votes\\n!|Pct\\n!\\n|-\\n|[[U.S. House election, 1992|1992]]\\n|\\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} |{{nowrap|'''[[Richard J.
